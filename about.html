        <p style="color: rgb(52, 6, 99);">A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee
            of various types, e.g. espresso,
            latte, and cappuccino. Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee, iced tea, and other
            non-caffeinated
            beverages. In continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light
            snacks,
            sandwiches, muffins, fruit, or pastries. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large
            multinational
            corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various
            countries around the world.
        
            While café may refer to a coffeehouse, the term "café" generally refers to a diner, British café (colloquially
            called a
            "caff"), "greasy spoon" (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual
            eating and drinking place.[1][2][3][4][5] A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or
            restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many coffeehouses in the Middle East and in West Asian immigrant
            districts in the Western world offer shisha (actually called nargile in Levantine Arabic, Greek and Turkish),
            flavored
            tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and
            espresso-based drinks.</p>
